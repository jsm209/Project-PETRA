# PETRA #
#########
A fast paced, bullet hell shooter.
Main character is a female space hunter who shoots lasers.
Enemies evolve over the amount of time they're left to walk around.
When enemies die, they drop money.
The entire game takes place in a single, large level (cyberpunk alleways and stuff).

You farm the enemies for money, but the only place you can regain air is your base.

You upgrade stats by buying from merchants that wander the map (therefore they have random locations). 
Can upgrade breath, ammo, speed, health.

# Enemies #
###########
There is only one kind of enemy, and it's a rock with white eyes that pursue the player.
They have three attributes, health, speed, and damage.
They start with a randomized base amount for each stat, depending on some kind of health of player + time formula. They also start with a pool of points to spend on their stats, also depending on current health and timer of player.
Every 10 seconds they will spend 1/6 of their points on a random stat, so that if left alive for a full minute they evolve to their full form.
Those gained stats reflect in their appearence, health = size, damage = how pink they are, speed = how blue they are.
